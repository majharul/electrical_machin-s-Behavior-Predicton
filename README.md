# electrical_machine-s-Behavior-Predicton
Suppose we have an electrically operated general purpose industrial machine (i.e Generator, Motor, Electrical Machines) which has been purchased for a manufacturing process plant. Typically the machine has to run whole day to remain the prodution process running smoothly. In this work our goal is to plan and design a solution and to execute different machine learning algorithms to compare the performances to predict the machine's life expectency of the respective machine.  if we can predict the next shutdown before a forced shutdown then we can use the machine or run the machine(i.e: Motor) in an optimum condition to achieve maximum life expectency.
# Specific Challenges
Creating a dummy random dataset
Data Cleansing and Preporcessing
Outliers detection
Ploting and Normalization
Finding highly corelative feature that impact the machine Performances
Proposing and Appropriate ML algorithm
Training and Performace analysis of ML Model
Comparing between different ML algorithm
Providing recomendation for life expectency of Generator
# Data Set Property
Data attributes
the generated data is for an electrical machines(motor for a washing machine plant) data has x row and y column Primary observation. From the dataset we can predict next schedule of maintenance and we will collect the data from a single machines but using similar technique and logging data for same model's multiple machine we can predict life expectency lately. So in this work we will focus on a single machine data to find the next shutdown or to predict the next shutdown/maintenance before it happens forcefully.
