Suppose we have an electrically operated general purpose industrial machine (i.e Generator, Motor, Electrical Machines) which has been purchased for a manufacturing process plant. Typically the machine has to run whole day to remain the prodution process running smoothly. In this work our goal is to plan and design a solution and to execute different machine learning algorithms to compare the performances to predict the machine's life expectency of the respective machine.  if we can predict the next shutdown before a forced shutdown then we can use the machine or run the machine(i.e: Motor) in an optimum condition to achieve maximum life expectency.
